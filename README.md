# Criminal-Identification-System
The Criminal Identification System project employs Python and OpenCV to build an advanced security solution. This software can seamlessly integrate with public CCTV cameras, enabling the automatic identification of known criminals. Once a match is made, the system triggers immediate alerts to the nearest police stations, facilitating rapid responses to criminal activities. Furthermore, this project offers a user-friendly interface for law enforcement agencies to register new criminals in the database, expanding its capabilities. It serves as a robust tool in enhancing public safety and security, providing real-time monitoring and efficient crime prevention through the power of computer vision and alert notifications.
